**Goal**: Besides Covid-19, another natural catastrophe--a 21 numbered floods (floods of a certain large scale) hit China in 2020 and is described as the worst floods since 1998. Started in early June 2020, heavy rains caused by the regional rainy season led to floods severely affecting large areas of southern China including the Yangtze River and its longest tributary, the Han River. According to the Ministry of Water Resources, a total of 443 rivers nationwide have been flooded, with 33 of them swelling to the highest levels ever recorded. 

The **2020 China floods** has affected 63.46 million people and caused a direct economic loss of 178.96 billion CNY. Flood hazard has always been one of the most harmful disasters in China, so it is significant to obtain information on flood characteristics and vulnerability assessment of flood regions. With the goalto develops a GIS-based distributed model for simulating flood inundation, we choose the HanRiver as a study case and collected precipitation data,  inflow discharge,  and water level in-formation in city Wuhan, a city at the confluence of the Han and Yangtze rivers.  We applythe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM data in the environment of GIS, and useLISFLOOD-FP, a raster-based flood inundation simulation software designed by the Universityof Bristol.  We design a model that takes a one-dimensional diffusion wave representation forchannel flow and a two-dimensional dynamic wave approximation of overland flow solved withthe application of an implicit finite difference scheme. And the exchange of flows between riverchannel and overland surface is calculated through Manningâ€™s formula.
